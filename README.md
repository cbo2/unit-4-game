# unit-4-game
This game allows the user to select from 4 shapes that have hidden point values.  The goal is to match the 
the aggregate points to a random number that is selected and displayed at the start of each turn of the game.
If the user goes over, they lose.  Once a turn is completed by way of winning (matching the random total) or losing
the wins/losses is updated on the navbar and then the game resets for a new turn.

This game makes use of bootstrap to be responsive.  I also ensured each of the shapes gets a unique value between 1 and 12 via a
nested for loop.  Game also uses jQuery. 

I linked it to my portfolio.
